# Project Title: Tech Life Balance – A BI-Driven Approach to Mental Wellbeing

## 1. Project Annotation

In this Business Intelligence (BI) project, we investigate the relationship between digital behavior patterns—such as screen time, device usage, and online activity—and their impact on mental health indicators like stress, mood, sleep quality, and anxiety. Our dataset includes user-reported data on device usage, daily habits, and wellness metrics. The aim is to identify hidden patterns and correlations that can guide users toward healthier digital lifestyles.

This challenge is highly relevant as digital overuse has become a common yet often overlooked factor affecting mental health. The expected outcome of the project is an interactive BI dashboard and report offering insights, predictive trends, and practical recommendations based on user profiles. The solution could positively impact individuals, mental wellness app providers, and institutional wellness programs (e.g., universities, HR departments).

## 2. Problem Statement

### Context
Digital devices are now central to everyday life, but prolonged use—especially on phones and social media—has been associated with decreased mental health. By analyzing behavioral and mental health data, I aim to better understand how screen time and lifestyle choices affect well-being.

### Purpose
To use BI tools to analyze behavioral patterns and provide actionable insights that promote healthier digital habits and better mental health outcomes.

### Research Questions
- How do various forms of screen time correlate with stress levels, mood ratings, and sleep quality?
- What combinations of digital usage and lifestyle factors lead to higher or lower mental health scores?
- Can we segment users into risk groups based on their habits?
- What recommendations can be derived for different user profiles?

### Hypotheses
- H1: Higher daily phone usage is positively correlated with stress and lower mood ratings.
- H2: Users with more mindfulness minutes and lower caffeine intake show better sleep quality and mental health scores.
- H3: Individuals living in urban areas have higher screen time and stress levels than those in suburban locations.
